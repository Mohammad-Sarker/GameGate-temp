                <h2>Elden Ring (2022)</h2>
                <p> The Golden Order has been broken. <br>

                    Rise, Tarnished, and be guided by grace to brandish the power of the Elden Ring and become an Elden Lord in the Lands Between.
                    
                    In the Lands Between ruled by Queen Marika the Eternal, the Elden Ring, the source of the Erdtree, has been shattered.
                    
                    Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring known as the Great Runes, and the mad taint of their newfound strength triggered a war: The Shattering. A war that meant abandonment by the Greater Will.
                    
                    And now the guidance of grace will be brought to the Tarnished who were spurned by the grace of gold and exiled from the Lands Between. Ye dead who yet live, your grace long lost, follow the path to the Lands Between beyond the foggy sea to stand before the Elden Ring.
                    
                     <br>
                    
                    And become the Elden Lord.</p>

                "Dark Souls is one of my favorite games. So to see From Software return to the interconnected metroidvania spaghetti level design of first half of Dark Souls but on the scale of an entire BOTW-style open world is mind-blowing. Art, combat, level design, and atmosphere are all at their best here. Games like these are once in a lifetime. "

                  "This is the perfect culmination of everything Fromsoft has ever done with the Souls series. PSO2 NGS led me to believe that open-world grassy field type game will always be soulless (pun not intended) and unfinished, but this game has content in EVERY corner of the map."

                "The best open world I've ever encountered--moreso than any other open world game, and moreso than any other modern Fromsoft game, this thing feels like a journey, where I've truly gone through so much by the end of the game that I feel like a different person than the one I was when I started. Gargantuan, beautiful, brutal, and honestly more terrifying than an outright horror game like Bloodborne. Masterpiece."
